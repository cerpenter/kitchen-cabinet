<section><h2>The Fact That Most Homes Have Matching Cabinets […]</h2><br/><p>A contrasting kitchen island is a great way to inject color into your kitchen. Your kitchen island does not have to match. If it is a very small kitchen, i think the island should match the cabinetry (otherwise it can look too busy).</p><h2>See Below For Where To Use Each.</h2><br/><p>Here are things to consider when mixing and matching kitchen island and cabinet countertops. I love to mix finishes in a kitchen because i think it adds character and a timeless quality to the room. Once you choose your matching cabinets and countertops, one of the best ways to tie the whole kitchen together is to choose the right accessories.</p><h2>However, If You Split Them They Should Follow A Vertical Line At Counter Height, Or Else You Should Pick One Style To Use On The Whole Pantry Area, So There’s A Subtle Consistency The Eye Can Pick Up On.</h2><br/><p>Your kitchen island does not have to match. For example, if the cabinets along the perimeter of your kitchen are in glossy white laminate finish, you can either use stainless steel for your kitchen island. Although matching an island to surrounding cabinets and countertops creates symmetry within a kitchen, using different cabinet colors or different countertops can turn an island into a beautiful focal point that complements the rest of your kitchen.</p><h2>This Could Have Benefited From A Stronger, Darker Floor.</h2><br/><p>Selecting the island as one of the primary or contrasting colors can create a beautiful focal point. If the bathroom in question is a powder room off the kitchen, you might consider matching the cabinetry to provide flow from one space to the next. Should your kitchen island match your cabinets?</p><h2>Mug Tree / Cookbook &amp; Tablet Stand.</h2><br/><p>In a larger kitchen it is nice to have some contrast. Again, the answer is no especially if you don’t want to settle for the classic style. Although matching your kitchen island to surrounding cabinets and countertops creates symmetry within a kitchen, using different cabinet colors or different countertops can turn an island into a beautiful focal point that complements the rest of your kitchen.</p></section><section><aside><img title="A Guide to Matching Your to Your Kitchen Island" alt="A Guide to Matching Your to Your Kitchen Island" rel="nofollow" src="https://i2.wp.com/kitchenbathdesigns.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/francesca-tosolini-ykHFS4Ul64U-unsplash.jpg" rel="nofollow"width="100%" style="margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;" /><small><i>Images: pinterest.com</i></small><p>My kitchen is open to the family room and my fireplace has a white painted mantel.
